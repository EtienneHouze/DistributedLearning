## Context and goal
    This repository is a project realized with the Keras API during an internship in Bentley Systems.
    It is meant to study and implement neural network based image dense labelling with further goal to label 3D models. Since labelled 3D meshes data is not easily found, it was preferable to study labelling on the input 2D images.
       The dataset used in this project is CityScape dataset, see the references at the end of this file.
